# maroc-account-checker

This program was made for checking if an individual account or a group of them are active (The credentials are correct) or if not.

There isn´t too much difficulty for use it, if you are going to use the Automatic Mode you must have an "accounts.txt" file in the same folder that
the program is saved, it must contain the accounts in the next format (one account per line)

email:password

Why "maroc"?

I love Felfort´s Marroc Chocolate, so... Just erase 1 "r" and you got it.

i´m not responsible about where you obtain the accounts that are being checked or if you use the program with a bad intention.
